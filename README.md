# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

# Submit Function Documentation

## Overview

The `submit` function is a part of a React component responsible for handling the submission of a post. It manages both the creation of a new post and the update of an existing post. The function interacts with an Appwrite service to upload images, manage file IDs, and update the post data.

## Parameters

- `data`: An object containing information about the post, typically obtained from a form. It includes details such as title, content, image, status, etc.

## Flow of Execution

### Update Existing Post

1. **Check if Post Exists**: Determine if the post being updated already exists (`post` is truthy).
2. **Upload New Image (if provided)**: If a new image is associated with the updated post, upload it to the Appwrite service.
3. **Delete Old Image**: If a new image is uploaded, delete the old image associated with the post from the Appwrite service.
4. **Update Post Data**: Use the Appwrite service to update the post data, including the new image ID.
5. **Navigate to Updated Post**: If the post update is successful, navigate to the page displaying the updated post.

### Create New Post

1. **Upload Image**: Upload the image associated with the new post to the Appwrite service.
2. **Obtain Image ID**: Obtain the ID of the uploaded image from the Appwrite service.
3. **Add Image ID to Post Data**: Include the image ID in the post data.
4. **Create New Post**: Use the Appwrite service to create a new post with the provided data and the associated image ID.
5. **Navigate to New Post**: If the post creation is successful, navigate to the page displaying the newly created post.

## Error Handling

- The function is designed to handle errors gracefully. If an error occurs during the image upload, post update, or post creation, it is logged, and the error is thrown to be handled by higher-level components.

## Usage

The `submit` function is typically called in response to a form submission event, and it serves as the central logic for managing post updates and creations.

### Example

```javascript
// Assuming the function is a part of a React component
const handleSubmit = async (postData) => {
  try {
    // Call the submit function with post data
    await submit(postData);
  } catch (error) {
    // Handle any errors that occurred during submission
    console.error("Submission failed:", error);
  }
};

// Usage in a form submission event
<form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
  {/* Form inputs */}
  <button type="submit">Submit</button>
</form>;
```
